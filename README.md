# FIPS to GNIS Map

A list of every FIPS code (Census Code) and its corresponding GNIS ID. This is nothing but a long CSV file, listing only the IDs. This includes every FIPS code—not every GNIS ID—and is derived from [`NationalFedCodes_20140601.zip`](http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/federalcodes/NationalFedCodes_20140601.zip) at [the U.S. Board of Geographic Names' website]. It's simply that file, with all data stripped out other than our two fields.

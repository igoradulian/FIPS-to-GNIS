# FIPS to GNIS Map

A list of every FIPS code (Census Code) and its corresponding GNIS ID. This is nothing but a long CSV file, listing only the IDs. This includes every FIPS code—not every GNIS ID—and is derived from [`NationalFedCodes_20140601.zip`](http://geonames.usgs.gov/docs/federalcodes/NationalFedCodes_20140601.zip) at the U.S. Board of Geographic Names' website. It's simply that file, with all data stripped out other than our two fields.

# To Do

* Document how I put this file together, so that it can be updated periodically (or repeated by somebody else), since FIPS and GNIS are updated as geographic units change.
